I still treasure the memories of my childhood. Sunny forest, I am 12, my brother 14 and my mom gathering some wildberries to eat it with bread. Was that the only food for that week?  I was happy at the forest, but I was crying afterwards: Why my beloved parents, like many millions, lost their engineering jobs, and money in hyperinflation. Why they was tortured by their inability to buy food for me and my brother?

That was the reason why I started to study economics, get to NES to figure out the economic freedom concept. In particular, my parents and 140+ millions Russians did not have a vital economic freedom: protected property rights on their money.

My parents’ money were stripped by the central bank. The bank printed money to lend to friends. Many of them massively bought dollars and assets, grilling hyperinflation of nearly 1000%. They would-sell some assets in a year with c.1000%  profit to return worthless rubles to the bank. They would do everything to keep his friend to reign the bank, so those who understands what is going on are too weak to push him out of the chair. The central banker was called the worst in history in the Economist. Yes, that is not likely to be that black and white, yet hope you got the concept.



Due to lack of property rights people deliver 20x below their potential

If one has power which is not counterbalanced, the power will be predatory used to gain more power. If politician can gain power to devide society and arm her clients for wars to strip property - the war is immenent, civil or global.

If property rights are weak, predators will come. Property redistribution fuels power of predators, which once may destroy the planet. Planet needs protected property rights to survive. The more people are stakeholders of the future - the better it will be.

Property rights normally works when in place:

1. Political competition
2. Independent media
3. Independent courts
4. Independent central bank

This heavy political machine costs quarter of global product and works poorly in most of the countries.

Blockchain enforces property rights with consensus protocols instead of politics. It works worldwide for any internet user even if her lives in a civil war.
