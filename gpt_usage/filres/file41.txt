Batch Interview is your first meeting with your potential supervisor and (sometimes) CEO. You will be able to learn about the company mission, products, culture and demonstrate proof of your capacity to deliver.

  Be well prepared to highlight your key achievements and background relevant for the role you applied. Try to fit in 60-90 seconds. Remember the rule “Waste of time is suicide. Waste of others time is a mass murder. Tell meaningful stories.”

  The batch acquaintance usually takes 30 minutes, and includes a short company introduction. Note that this stage is a group interview, therefore each candidates gets 1-2 minutes for a short self-presentation ー use that time to impress the interviewers and move to the next stage.

  Top candidates or those who have a next interviewer available could get a shortcut straight to one-on-one interview with Hiring Manager (Supervisor) right after Batch Interview.

  Please, follow Zoom instruction before the interview.

  Check your e-mail for an invitation to proceed further.





New companies generally should not exist.

New companies could exist only because they put together far greater team to build such a greater product to punch through status quo.
