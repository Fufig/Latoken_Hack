The Get Shit Done sign on the Revolut office wall illuminate the reason why Revolut went so far from 0 to c.$9 billion valuation.

If one proves to others that a task is undoable, her has less responsibility and more friends cooperating to avoid effort and replicate this shit pattern. So others have to get this shit done.

Excuse seekers prove to others why they do not need to do an extra effort and get out of comfort to make a critical hit. So they have spare time and energy to protect their status quo agains other teammates those who are focusing to get things done. Thus teammates have not only to get things done but also have shit done produced by excuse seekers. Shit is a habit to avoid responsibility and collude to do so against other teammates.

Do you keep silence when someone is tweaking facts, inventing or selecting data to prove that a task is undoable?

Get rid of this shit. React immediately, do not a silent part of such shit. Raise the Bar.

Leverage The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future



Instinctively I do want recognition, higher titles, salary, influence and want less responsibility and effort. So I have higher risk adjusted ROI on my effort. If I do not measure the result for clients and do not take responsibility for that then the value for clients is not in my ROI formula. Of course I use energy only on variables in my ROI formula: recognition, titles, salary, influence.. No client metrics here. And I feel demotivated if I do not get recognition etc for consulting teammates and jumping around, I feel tensions of normal and median people. That is the lack of commitment and accountability well described in theFive dysfunctions of teams.  Constructive Ð¡onflict
