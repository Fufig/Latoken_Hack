“Make your Bed” every morning

Today, we found that the Bed for operations is the accuracy of Platform ops interfaces. Like Bed for Navy Seals, it is seen by most of the teammates each morning and sets attitude to their other tasks from a DB or a code architecture to communications with clients.  How they chose the structure, size, color of fonts, blocks, shortcuts are small vector that gravitates us constantly.

Know what is your  “Bed”

Which small daily task sets the day for all of us? Is it Stories, Standups, your OKR report?

Find the weak heart and eliminate from ever becoming a Navy Seal.

Today, I interviewed another cancer, which was proud to tell that he is working only 15% of his day for Yandex which he joined 6 months ago. He was proud to tell that the Sovok deserves to be cheated and teammates are ok to have him as a bar lower.

Find the weak heart and eliminate from ever becoming a Navy Seal



Basic SEAL training is six months of long torturous runs in the soft sand, midnight swims in the cold water off San Diego, obstacles courses, unending calisthenics, days without sleep and always being cold, wet and miserable.

It is six months of being constantly harassed by professionally trained warriors who seek to find the weak of mind and body and eliminate them from ever becoming a Navy SEAL.

But, the training also seeks to find those students who can lead in an environment of constant stress, chaos, failure and hardships [of new markets].

Startup teammates are navy seals defeating entropy on undiscovered territory to build the future. If you want to change the world..

Get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward

“For failing the uniform inspection, the student had to run, fully clothed into the surf zone and then, wet from head to toe, roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand. The effect was known as a “sugar cookie.” You stayed in that uniform the rest of the day — cold, wet and sandy.



There were many a student who just couldn’t accept the fact that all their effort was in vain. That no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right — it was unappreciated. Those students didn’t make it through training.

Those students didn’t understand the purpose of the drill. You were never going to succeed. You were never going to have a perfect uniform. Sometimes no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform, you still end up as a sugar cookie. It’s just the way life is sometimes. If you want to change the world, get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.”

Implication for LATOKEN: be ready to endure negative feedback from the market, blackmailers and enviers. If we have trained our IEO team they might have endure launch of tokenized interest in SpaceX. Thus we would be way more advanced in IEO product.
